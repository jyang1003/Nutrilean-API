## Tech Stack
This app was created with the MERN stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. 

- MongoDB is NoSQL database program. It is a non-relational database, meaning it does not use tables, allowing for a more agile and flexible manipulation of data. 

- Expres is a NodeJS framework that provides a myriad of methods and middleware to communicate with the database. 

- React is a framework/library used to create an interactive user interface. It updates and renders the pages as the data and code change. 

- Node is an asynchronus event-driven runtime environment. It allows us to run JavaScript on a server, tying the frontend and backend together.
